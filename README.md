# Node.jsSandBox
Using this repository as a personal way to practice Node.js

1.) Run npm inside the firstNodeApp folder. Run the command "$npm start" to start local host
2.) Go to page localHost:1414 to view project
3.) App currently has 3 pages:
  a.) / (homePage)
  b.) /users (currently empty [would display users]
  c.) /secondPage (second page that includes the current date)
